## Explicación de la solución
The idea is to enhance the project using particle systems. We need to incorporate features like trails, noise, gravity, rotation, collisions, repellers, and force fields.

- I created an electric creature that emits electric rays. In this context, I implemented trails and noise to create the effect of electricity.

- For the gravity and rotation effects, I applied a fading effect to the food. The food gradually disappears while the crumbs fall to the bottom.

- When the fishes feed on the seaweed, crumbs fall to the floor, resulting in collisions as the crumbs interact with the floor.

- Finally, I implemented repellers and force fields using sand and a circular seaweed. When the sand falls, the circular seaweed repels it
